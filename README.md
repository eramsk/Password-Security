# Password-Security
Created an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on the following criteria:
1. Minimum password length should be 8 characters.
2. Maximum password length should be 128 characters.
3. Anyone one character set should be used- Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers or Special Characters.

after the user enters the criteria a random password validating all the criteria is displayed in the textbox.

if the user does not select any criteria then an error pops up alerting the user to select atleast one character set.
